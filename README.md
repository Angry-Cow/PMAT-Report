# PMAT-Report
Repository for the posting of the course final report from Practical Malware Analysis &amp; Triage course by Matt Kiely
The course is available at https://academy.tcm-sec.com.

This report is the course final.  I can say that I learned a lot with this course but still have a long way to go.  T have been through all of this course twice, some of it more than that trying to get it to sink in.
I have included the report as a word doc and pfd.  I also included my notes taken as a pdf file.  I did the notes in one note.  I spent a decade atleast avoiding onenote.  I saw how quick and easy it was in use during the course, that I went with it and for this purpose at least I like it.
If someone actually reads this report and has some constructive criticism, I would love to hear it. Im not really sure how this whole git hub thing works quite yet, but if there is a way to leave constructive comments and remarks, please do.
